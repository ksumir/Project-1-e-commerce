# Project 1 e-commerce
__This project include tasks:__

*1. Run an A/B test and decide if the new payment method on the website should be made available to all users.*

__`tech stack:`__ `EDA`, `A/B test`: chi2 (chi-squared), t-test, `Python`: Jupyter Notebook (pandas, requests, json, urllib.parse, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, numpy, scipy.stats, pingouin)

__`steps:`__ <br>
• performing EDA, <br>
• checking the data distribution on graphs, <br>
• selecting, calculating metrics (CR, ARPU, average order value), and conducting A/B tests (chi2, t-test), <br>
• reaching conclusions.

*2. Write a function that automatically loads data from an additional file and recalculates the metrics.*

__`steps:`__ <br>
• creating function, <br>
• loading data, <br>
• preparing data for metric calculation, <br>
• calculating metrics, <br>
• creating the final df with all metrics, <br>
• create a function that will plot graphs based on the obtained metrics.

*3. Write an optimal SQL query that provides information on the number of very diligent students and, in the one query, outputs metrics by user groups: ARPU, ARPAU and CR.*

__`tech stack:`__ `Python`: Jupyter Notebook (pandahouse), `SQL`: ClickHouse
